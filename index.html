  	<p>Looking for tactics that will increase sales for your online business?</p>
  	<p>Here's a strategy that works for software, SaaS, digital products and e-commerce stores.</p>

    <h2>Why bite-sized is best:</h2>
    <p>Remember being a poor college student and going home just so you could eat your parent's food?</p>
    <p>I used to do that: I'd try to fit in a week's worth of calories into a single meal.</p>
    <p>The result? Indigestion. ;)</p>
    <p>Here's why pursuing small wins over time is a better strategy:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Marketing doesn't work like a slot-machine.</strong> You're not going to hit it big with &quot;one killer strategy.&quot; Rather, it's investing in multiple tactics over time that produces the best outcomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing is a lot like physical fitness.</strong> Small gains every week give you biggest gains in the long term. It's like hitting the gym once on January 1st and expecting to look like Arnold Schwartnegger. You've got to do something every week to get a better overall outcome.</li>
      <li><strong>For many of you, marketing is a big, hairy, ugly problem</strong>. And what's the best way to deal with a big overwhelming problem? Break it into smaller pieces. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Quit searching for the perfect growth hack</h2>
    <p>Here's what to do instead: ever week, pick a small marketing tactic and implement it on your site.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One week, install Google Webmaster tools.<br>
        </li>
      <li>The next week, try blogging on Medium.<br>
        </li>
      <li>The week after that, try running a Facebook campaign.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Try something new every week, evaluate the results, and then double down on the tactics that work.</p>
<p>BTW – this is exactly why I built <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">Tiny Marketing Wins</a>. Every week, I guide you through a new marketing tip.</p>
    <p>By the end of the year, these &quot;tiny&quot; steps will turn into big wins overall.</p>
